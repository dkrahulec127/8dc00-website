    "This notebook provides an explanation of the fundamental steps for installing your Python distributor, configuring your Python environment, and using basic Python commands. The first part of this notebook will also give you important information on how to debug your code in case something does not work as expected. Code bugs, glitches and unexpected behavior occur frequently whenever you develop code snippets, test your implementation or integrate parts of your code into someone else's template.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Info for exercises on image registration:** \n",
    "In the following exercises, you will first implement Python definitions for computing transformation matrices for different geometrical transformations. Then, you will implement code for converting a transformation matrix into a homogeneous form. All information needed for implementing these functions can be found in corresponding lecture slides and/or previous parts of this notebook. In the beginning, you will apply the transformations to geometric objects, however, the same functions will be later used for image transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Info for exercises on CAD:**\n",
    "In this set of exercises you will implement linear regression and logistic regression methods, apply them to \"toy\" datasets and then evaluate and analyze the results. As with the other sets of exercises, the goal is to help you better study and understand the material and lay down the ground work for the corresponding mini-project. You should not wait to complete all exercises before moving to work on the project. For example, after completing the exercises on linear regression, you can already start with the linear regression experiments required for the project work. \n",

    "### 1.1 Python installation and configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will be working with Anaconda (a Python distribution platform). The following instructions give an overview of essential steps prior to using Jupyter notebooks on Windows. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how to install your Python distribution platform including your software development environment (optional for this course, advisable for your future assignments):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Download](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and install Anaconda (it automatically comes with the latest Python version)\n",
    "2. Follow the instructions in the dialogue window. Make sure to check the box **Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable** in order to be able to use Jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "3. Installation will follow\n",
    "4. To check whether the path to Anaconda has been added to your environment variables, go to *Edit the system environment variables* in the start menu, and click the *Environment Variables* button in the dialogue window.\n",
    "5. Optionally, install Pycharm, however, Jupyter notebooks can easily be maintained in a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a Jupyter notebook editor, you have several options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open Anaconda Navigator (may take some time to open), and launch Jupyter\n",
    "- Open a Windows command prompt / Windows Powershell, and type `jupyter notebook` (note the space in between); this way will only work if you have added Anaconda to your Path\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='py_terminal'></a>\n",
    "### 1.2 Using Python terminal, setting up a Python environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with setting up a Python environment, follow the instructions in the `Getting Started` section of the [Essential Skills](https://github.com/tueimage/essential-skills/blob/master/python-essentials.md) Python module. \n",
    "\n",
    "To progress efficiently in this course, you will need to install additional Python packages that are not included in the basic Anaconda Python distribution. It is recommended to install these packages in a dedicated Python environment. A Conda environment is a directory in which you can install files and packages such that their dependencies will not interact with other environments, which is very useful if you develop code for different courses or research projects. These packages can either be installed using a conda YML file or manually using the conda and/or pip package managers. To run the complete development environment for this course, you need to install five additional Python packages: `matplotlib, jupyter, scikit-learn, scipy and spyder`. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the Anaconda terminal from the start menu\n",
    "2. Create an environment: <br>\n",
    "    2.1 **From a `.yml` file**: `conda env create -f environment.yml` (the name of the environment will be set automatically according to the first line in the `.yml` file); then run `conda activate myenv` (where `myenv` corresponds to the name of your environment); eventually, to verify that the instlalation finished successfully, type `conda env list`<br>\n",
    "    2.2 **From command line**: `conda create --name myenv` (to create an environment with a specific Python version, specify the version at the end of this command line `python=3.6`; and to add specific packages to the environment, specify them afterwards in the same command line, <br> e.g. `conda create -n myenv python=3.6 scipy=0.15.0 numpy nibabel`).\n",
    "    \n",
    "Using both ways, the default destination folder for your newly created Python environment will be in `C:\\path-to-anaconda\\envs\\myenv`. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='basic_imp_eng_math'></a>\n",
    "### 1.3 Implementation of basic engineering and mathematical techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Best way to learn the basics of programming is to study Python essentials in the [Essential Skills](https://github.com/tueimage/essential-skills/blob/master/python-essentials.md) notebook of the course. Additionally, a comprehensive reference book with examples on applying mathematical models as well as machine learning in Python can be found [HERE](https://www.halvorsen.blog/documents/programming/python/resources/Python%20for%20Science%20and%20Engineering.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Jupyter notebook workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be that you cannot fully view your Jupyter notebooks on the GitHub webpage. Therefore, it is **strongly recommended** to clone the GitHub repository to your local folder (free to choose by yourself), and work locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='jn_ui'></a>\n",
    "### 2.1 User interface and useful commands in Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "(making new cells, Markdown syntax, ipython magic commands)\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='jn_debugging'></a>\n",
    "### 2.2 How to efficiently search for solutions to Python errors\n",
    "(numpy) APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='jn_workflow'></a>\n",
    "### 2.3 Debugging and editing your Python code directly in Jupyter notebook\n",
    "(breakpoints, debugging tools in running Jupyters)\n",
    "\n",
    "Editing code directly in Jupyter Notebook, which offers no linting, auto-complete or other creature comforts of a decent IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several open-source Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) enabling fast and efficient software development, code editing and debugging. Examples of these tools are PyCharm, MS Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text, to name some. On the bright side, such code editors offer miscellaneous aids, such as auto-complete, suggestions for code enhancements, automatic installation of missing Python libraries, etc. While all these features make it much easier to develop your functionalities, setting up an IDE might be cumbersome, especially if you have never worked with any code editing software before. Eventually, these IDEs yield larger benefits when working on extensive projects that entail much more code writing, integration, and testing compared with what is necessary in this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is essential you learn how to debug and edit your Python code directly in Jupyter notebooks (in a web browser). Here are a few tips and tricks:\n",

    "**Some remarks on the notation used in the notebooks:**<br>\n",
    "Vectors and matrices are represented by a bold typeface, matrices with uppercase and vectors with lowercase letters, e.g. the matrix $\\mathbf{X}$, the vector $\\mathbf{w}$ etc. Compare this with the notation for scalars: $X$, $w$. In-line Python function (i.e. definition) names, commands, files and variables are represented in a highlighted monospace font, e.g. `X`, `w`, `imshow(I)`, `some_python_definition()`, `some_file.py` etc.\n",
